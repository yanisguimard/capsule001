Checking the basic syntax of a language can be more time consuming than it should as very few of the resources available are succint, usually in the form of documentation or tutorials. Capsule001 is a simple website implemented with Ruby on Rails allowing developers to jump from a programming language to another through synthetic and organized memo cards.

It is hosted on Heroku and is in continuous development:
